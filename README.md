# What is this?
As developer, we need to go through our designer's mockup to produce the same appearance and feeling by code.

Have you ever felt troublesome to get the exact frame of an UI element? 

The mockup looks sharp, but your app looks fuzzy just because the view shifts serveral pixels?

That's all I have experienced. 
So, may be you need this Utility.

Drag to make your selection on an image and get the frame in an ios-coordinate

# How it looks

# Usage
- Mouse Drag
- Keyboard Arrow Keys
- With Shift key pressed, use arrow keys to resize selection

# What is more
It is actually only a practice project for my Cocoa learning. Not so serious XD
But any advice is welcomed!
